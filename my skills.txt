Hello, I'm Ritik Dutta, a passionate IT professional with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a Master’s diploma in Full Stack Data Science from iNeuron. Since the age of 13, I've been on a clear path towards the IT domain, exploring various fields including game design, cyber security, app development, operating systems, IoT, and web development. Over the past 5-6 years, I've focused on data science, Additionally, I embarked on my certification journey in machine learning from reputable platforms early on, approximately 5-6 years ago, this will ensure my longstanding commitment and early initiation into the field of data science..

In my professional career, I've accumulated 1.5 years of experience working at iNeuron as a Computer Vision Engineer and Full Stack Data Scientist

My work includes dissecting complex deep learning models. I've lead in advanced projects involving computer vision, NLP, and notably, automating a backend ETL pipeline that streamlined data processing workflows. My technical expertise also covers backend areas like CI/CD pipelines, app deployment, login authentication management, databases, and code management with agile workflow.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply committed to social welfare. I volunteer in feeding and teaching underprivileged children, supporting their families in my city. My ultimate goal in my life is to leverage my full-stack technical skills to develop applications that benefit the public and support crucial sectors like government, defense, and the army.
