Q: tell me about challenging situation that you faced during your job and how you solved it?

A: "In my role as a Full Stack Data Scientist at iNeuron, I encountered a challenging situation while automating a backend ETL pipeline. The challenge was integrating disparate data sources with varying formats and ensuring real-time data processing without compromising the system's performance.

To address this, I first conducted a thorough analysis of the existing data sources and processing workflows. I then proposed a modular design that allowed for the seamless addition and processing of different data formats. Collaborating closely with my team, we iterated on the solution, incorporating feedback and testing rigorously to ensure reliability and efficiency.

By adopting a combination of advanced data processing techniques and optimizing our integration logic, we successfully automated the ETL pipeline, enhancing the data processing speed by over 40% and significantly reducing manual errors. This experience taught me the importance of analytical problem-solving, teamwork, and iterative development in overcoming complex challenges."

Q: How do you approach designing scalable, high-performance software solutions for the financial industry?
A: Designing Scalable, High-Performance Software Solutions
Short Answer: "My approach to designing scalable, high-performance software solutions, especially for the financial industry, centers on three key strategies: 1. Modularity – breaking down the system into manageable, interchangeable modules that can be scaled independently; 2. Efficiency – focusing on optimizing algorithms and resource usage to ensure high performance; and 3. Reliability – implementing robust error handling and recovery processes. By integrating these principles with continuous testing and feedback loops, I ensure the solution is not only scalable and performant but also resilient and adaptable to changing requirements."

Q: Can you share an example of a time when you had to lead a cross-functional team to achieve a specific goal? What was your role and what were the results?
A: On a complex computer vision project, my role was to lead a diverse team, including database handlers, frontend developers, and data scientists. The challenge? Ensuring seamless collaboration and integration across different technical domains. My approach was straightforward: implement an API technology that acted as a universal language, connecting each team's work smoothly. This not only solved our technical integration issues but also fostered a collaborative team environment. The result was a highly efficient quality check system that significantly improved our operational efficiency. This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication, adaptability, and the strategic use of technology to unite diverse skills towards a common goal."

Q: why u left ur previous job
A: I left my previous job because the company was shifting its focus towards the ed-tech domain following a merger with a larger company. While I have great respect for the direction they're taking and learned a lot during my time there, my passion and expertise lie more in the fields of data science and computer vision. I'm seeking opportunities where I can further apply and expand my skills in these areas, contributing to innovative projects and making a tangible impact.


Q:why are you not applied for job and u have career gap in ur work
A: As you know, I have a strong commitment to excellence and dedication when I start something. This extends to my professional life as well. I've been very selective in my job search because I'm looking for a significant opportunity with a company where I can commit long-term and contribute meaningfully. During this period, I've been focusing on honing my skills further, ensuring I'm not just a fit for a big company but an asset. My goal has always been to join an organization where I can grow, innovate, and contribute to large-scale projects over an extended period.

Q: why u choose data science 
A: I chose data science because it offers a transformative approach to coding and problem-solving. Unlike traditional programming, where I would define every rule, data science allows me to guide the application to discover its own rules. This shift from explicit instructions to facilitating self-learning in applications not only challenges me but also significantly enhances the potential solutions I can develop. It's the blend of creativity, analytical thinking, and the ability to impact the world through data that drew me to this field
